# Two Pointers

I put two fingers on the array and only move them forward. Opposite ends for a sorted pair or for water. Expand from a center for palindromes. Never rewind — that is why it stays O(n).

```js
// Two pointers skeleton — opposite ends
let left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
while (left < right) {
  // move the side that cannot be in a better answer
}
```

## Two Sum II

Sorted, so if the sum is too small I need a bigger left. Too big, smaller right. 1-based indexes on the return.

[Two Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

```js
// Two pointers — opposite ends
// LC: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) return [left + 1, right + 1];
    if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
  }
}
```

## Longest Palindromic Substring

Every palindrome has a center. I expand while left and right match. Do it for odd (`i,i`) and even (`i,i+1`) centers. Keep the longest slice.

[Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)

```js
// Two pointers — expand around center
// LC: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/
function longestPalindrome(s) {
  let best = "";
  const grow = (l, r) => {
    while (l >= 0 && r < s.length && s[l] === s[r]) {
      l--;
      r++;
    }
    return s.slice(l + 1, r);
  };
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    const odd = grow(i, i);
    const even = grow(i, i + 1);
    const cur = odd.length > even.length ? odd : even;
    if (cur.length > best.length) best = cur;
  }
  return best;
}
```

## Trapping Rain Water

Water at `i` is min(tallest on left, tallest on right) minus height[i]. Two pointers: I always move the shorter side, because that side’s bound is the one that limits water right now.

[Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

```js
// Two pointers — water limited by the shorter wall
// LC: https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/
function trap(height) {
  let left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
  let leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0, water = 0;
  while (left < right) {
    if (height[left] < height[right]) {
      leftMax = Math.max(leftMax, height[left]);
      water += leftMax - height[left];
      left++;
    } else {
      rightMax = Math.max(rightMax, height[right]);
      water += rightMax - height[right];
      right--;
    }
  }
  return water;
}
```
